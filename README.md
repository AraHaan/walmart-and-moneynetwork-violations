# Walmart Violations

The following are buiness violations from Walmart.

1. They do not care to help customers.
2. They do not care about safety of customers or their employees.
3. They do not care if walmart property damages customer property or kills someone (they claim no responsibility of merchandice falls over and kill someone, or their motorized carts mess up and hurts or kills someone).
4. They do not care if a customer gets over charged for something.
5. They got/want to get rid of quantity checkout which saves customers and their employees time.
6. Their management are disrespectful and act mean to customers.
7. Their employees and management do not want to help customers when they need help, instead they walk past and ignore them.
8. Their bathrooms, floors, ans shelving are often times dirty. Floors often with spills that can remain for hours where people can trip and get hurt.
9. They claim that they are an inclusive workforce and do not condone toxic behavior but they do not punish the employees that bully other employees or threaten them with going to management to get them fired and when they tell on the bully they do not get in trouble at all or they lie to management saying that they "never did it".
10. The overal environement for working at walmart is a combination of toxic and non-toxic depending on which employees you talk to (or they pretend not to be toxic to your face).
  - Walmart is not a great employer.
11. When they updated their wages from 12$ per hour to 17$ per hour they got rid of all of their benefits* (Needs verification on this one).
  - Their benefits included stock (for retirement), health care (full time only and dental included but the whole thing has to be paid for from the employees paycheck),  MyShare (when the store would do well).

# Money Network Violations (META Bank)

The following are buiness violations from Money Network (META Bank).

1. They fee you without notifying you that they are about to fee you if you lose your job at walmart and walmart does not notify you first (illegally stealing your money). And then notify you in mail *after* they took the entire ballance and claim that they cannot refund it.
  - in the policy on their packet it says that they CANNOT fee you without notification first, and the letter they send in the mail says they "will start feeing, but you can choose to transfer your ballance to another bank".
2. Their customer service is not helpful and they do not care about their card holders.

My Recomendations:
1. Walmart and Money Network (META Bank) should compensate all who they have wronged, if they end up going bankrupt doing so then that means their companies wronged too many people to keep their companies running.
2. Avoid shopping or working at Walmart or even opening an bank account for anything powered by META Bank (they will steal your money before even notifying you that they will fee and lie saying that their entry paperwork said they can fee you without prior notification (it says they wont without notifying you actually)).
3. Work somewhere else (Like Microsoft) that do not allow treating their customers or employees this way. Microsoft even offer entry level jobs paying $60,000 to people and they do not have to even ever go to college.
